# angularMultilingualUsingStaticFiles

Angular doesn't give much support to multi-language. We can use a plugin angular-translate.js to load the corresponding language values into our web page. Basically, we configure json files which has key, value pairs for each language and ask the translate directive to load them. For that we use 'useStaticFilesLoader' provided by the angular-translate plugin. If the language jsons are coming from server we can just write a service to set and get the values. This helps us a lot when we the files are stored in the file system. Also the files are lazily loaded. Since the examples given under angular-translate are of errors, I have implemented a sample of it and uploading here. Also they have not mentioned how to load json file which is not in the root path. It is not mandatory that the files should be there in the root path.
